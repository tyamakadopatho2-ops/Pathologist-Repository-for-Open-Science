5) Brief Summary

     This short communication reports the first documented case of a sporadic gastric foveolar-type adenoma (FA) exhibiting morular metaplasia (MM), a rare morphological finding previously unreported in gastric adenomas. The report includes detailed histopathological descriptions, immunohistochemical evaluations, and a concise discussion regarding the diagnostic and pathological significance of this unusual metaplastic change, as well as its biological aggressiveness and genetic abnormalities. The findings emphasize the need for awareness and further investigation of MM in gastric neoplasms, as well as the elucidation of its molecular mechanisms, including potential APC gene alterations in both FA and MM.
